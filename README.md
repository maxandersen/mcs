> Use [Maven Central Repository Search](https://search.maven.org/) from your command line!

Use `mcs` to quickly lookup dependency coordinates in Maven Central, without having to switch to your browser.

## Usage
This tool supports the following modes of searching:

1. **Wildcard search**
   ```console
   mcs search plexus-utils
   ```
   This will give you all artifacts in Maven Central that have "plexus-utils" in their name.
   The output is in a tabular form, showing the exact coordinate of each artifact and the moment when its latest version was deployed.
2. **Coordinate search**
   ```console
   mcs search org.codehaus.plexus:plexus-utils
   mcs search org.codehaus.plexus:plexus-utils:3.4.1
    ```
   If there are multiple hits, you will get the same table output as above.
   But if there's only one hit, this will give you by default a pom.xml snippet for the artifact you searched for.
   Ready for copy & paste in your favourite IDE!  
   If you require snippet in different format, use `-f <type>` or `--format=<type>`.
   Supported types are: `maven`, `gradle`, `gradle-short`, `gradle-kotlin`, `sbt`, `ivy`, `grape`, `leiningen`, `buildr`.
3. **Class-name search**
   ```console
   mcs class-search CommandLine
   mcs class-search -f picocli.CommandLine
   ```
   This will give you all artifacts in Maven Central that contain a particular class.
   If you set the `-f` flag, the search term is considered a "fully classified" class name, so including the package name.

All modes recognise the `-l <number>` switch, which lets you specify how many results you want to see _at most_.

## Installation
You can install mcs using the package manager of your choice:

| Package manager | Platform | Installation                        | Remarks |
|-----------------|----------|-------------------------------------|---------|
| **Homebrew**    | üçé üêß    | `brew install mthmulders/tap/mcs`   | ‚ö†Ô∏è 1    |
| **Snap**        | üêß       | `snap install maven-central-search` |         |
| **SDKMAN!**     | üçé üêß    | `sdk install mcs`                   |         |
| **Chocolatey**  | ü™ü       | `choco install mcs`                 |         |

1. The Linux binaries only work on x86_64 CPU's.
   There Apple binaries for both x86_64 and Apple Silicon, so you don't need Rosetta.

### Usage with custom trust store
In certain situations, such as when you work behind a TLS-intercepting (corporate) firewall, MCS may fail with

> PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target

In layman's speak: the default, built-in trust store (the set of trusted X.509 certificates) does not contain anything that allows to trust the certificate(s) presented by the server.
Maven Central uses a certificate that would've been trusted, but the culprit here is the TLS-intercepting (corporate) firewall that presents an internal certificate.

The solution is to create a trust store that has the "highest" certificate in the certificate chain, e.g. that of the (internal) certificate authority.
You can use a tool like [Portecle](https://portecle.sourceforge.net/) to create such a trust store.
Next, point MCS to that trust store like so

```
mcs -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/keystore search something
```

Or, even easier: create a directory **.mcs** in your user directory (typically **C:\Users\<your-user-name>** on ü™ü, **/home/<your-user-name>** on üêß or **/Users/<your-user-name>** on üçé).
Inside that folder, create a file **mcs.config** and write the following line in it:

```
javax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/keystore
```

This way, you don't have to remember passing the `-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=`.

## Contributing
Probably the easiest way to get a working development environment is to use Gitpod:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/mthmulders/mcs)

It will configure a workspace in your browser and show that everything works as expected by running `mvn verify`.
This setup does not touch your computer - as soon as you close your browser tab, it's gone.
